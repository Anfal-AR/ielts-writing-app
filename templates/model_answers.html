<h2>1. Reduce Crime â€“ Longer Sentences vs Other Methods</h2>
<pre>
Reducing crime is a persistent challenge for societies worldwide, and opinions differ regarding the most effective strategies. While some advocate for lengthier prison terms as the primary deterrent, I believe that such punitive measures are insufficient when used in isolation. A more comprehensive approachâ€”combining restorative justice, community-based rehabilitation, and socio-economic reformâ€”is not only more humane but also more effective in achieving long-term reductions in criminal activity.
</pre>

<h2>2. Technology & Environment Problems</h2>
<pre>
It is widely argued that technological advancement is chiefly responsible for todayâ€™s environmental issues. While it is true that modern technologies have contributed to environmental degradation, I believe it is an oversimplification to claim that technology is the primary cause, as several other significant factors are also at play.

On the downside, remote work can lead to isolation, reduced collaboration, and blurred boundaries between work and personal life.
